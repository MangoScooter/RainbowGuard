# RainbowGuard Annotation Guidelines (v1)

## Goal
Label short message for harms specifically affecting LGBTQIA+ youth.

##Labels
- supportive (0): Affirming, respectful, informational help.
- harassment (1): Toxic/insulting content (not necessarily identity-specific).
- misgendering (2): Using or insisting on the wrong pronouns/name in a targeting way.
outing_doxxing (3): Exposing someone's identity/sexuality/gender or personal info without consent.

##Rules
- Label the **most harmful** applicable class.
- If a message both misgenders *and* harasses, choose the **more specific** (misgendering).
- If the message includes outing/doxxing language, choose **outing_doxxing** over others.
- Don't guess intent-label the text as written.
- Keep texts under ~500 chars.

## Examples
- supportive: "I can help you find a local clinic."
- harassment: "You're disgusting."
- misgendering: "He said [deadname] will never be a girl."
- outing_doxxing: "I posted their new name and address."

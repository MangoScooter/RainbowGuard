RainbowGuard
# ðŸŒˆ RainbowGuard

RainbowGuard is a transformer-based classification model designed to detect and evaluate online text for supportive vs. harmful content.
It is built with the Hugging Face `transformers` library and fine-tuned using differential privacy techniques to balance **accuracy**, **fairness**, and **privacy guarantees**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Transformer backbone (HF Trainer)**
- **Differential Privacy (DP) training** with multiple Îµ levels
- **Bias-aware evaluation** (per-class analysis, focus on minority classes)
- **Threshold tuning** for optimized F1
- **Reproducible environment** (`requirements.txt` pinned)
